Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.
The comma (,) operator evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last operand. This is commonly used to provide multiple updaters to a for loop's afterthought.
example-
let x = 1;

x = (x++, x);

console.log(x);
// Expected output: 2

x = (2, 3);

console.log(x);
// Expected output: 3
