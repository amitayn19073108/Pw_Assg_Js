Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples?

ans:-Conditional statements in programming are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. These statements allow the program to execute different sets of instructions depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false.

In JavaScript, there are primarily two types of conditional statements: `if` statements and `switch` statements.

1. if statement:
   The basic syntax of an `if` statement is as follows:


   if (condition) {
  
   } else {
       
   }
   Example:

   let temperature = 25;

   if (temperature > 30) {
       console.log("It's a hot day!");
   } else {
       console.log("It's not too hot today.");
   }
   

2. if-else if-else statement:
   You can use the `else if` clause to check multiple conditions. Here's an example:

   let hour = 14;

   if (hour < 12) {
       console.log("Good morning!");
   } else if (hour < 18) {
       console.log("Good afternoon!");
   } else {
       console.log("Good evening!");
   }


3. switch statement:
   The `switch` statement is useful when you have a single variable with multiple possible values and you want to execute different code blocks based on the value of that variable.

  
   let dayOfWeek = 3;

   switch (dayOfWeek) {
       case 1:
           console.log("Monday");
           break;
       case 2:
           console.log("Tuesday");
           break;
       case 3:
           console.log("Wednesday");
           break;
       // ... other cases ...
       default:
           console.log("Unknown day");
   }

   Note that the `break` statement is crucial in a `switch` statement to prevent "fall-through," where code execution continues to the next case.

These conditional statements are fundamental for controlling the flow of a program based on different conditions.
