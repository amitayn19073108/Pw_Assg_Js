What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples?

Loops are programming constructs that allow you to repeat a certain block of code multiple times. They are crucial for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over collections of data. In JavaScript, there are several types of loops: for, while, and do-while. Each type has its own use cases and syntax.

 1. forLoop:

The forloop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to iterate.

Syntax:
javascript
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
    // code to be repeated
}


Example:
javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}



 2. whileLoop:

The whileloop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance and is based on a condition.

Syntax:
javascript
while (condition) {
    // code to be repeated
}


Example:
javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}



 3. do-whileLoop:

Similar to the whileloop, but the condition is checked after the block of code is executed, guaranteeing that the code block is executed at least once.

Syntax:
javascript
do {
    // code to be repeated
} while (condition);


Example:
javascript
let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);



 

  

These loop constructs are fundamental for creating efficient and expressive code in JavaScript, allowing you to perform tasks repeatedly with concise and readable code.
